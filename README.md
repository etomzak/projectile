# Projectile

A totally legit pygame game

## Installation

### Getting pygame on Linux

See [pygame docs](http://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted).

### Getting pygame on MacOS

MacOS doesn't have python3 by default. An easy way to get it is with
[Homebrew](https://brew.sh/). From a terminal, install Homebrew:

```
$> /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
$> brew update
```

Then install python3:

```
$> brew install python3
```

Then use pip to install pygame:

```
$> pip3 install pygame
```

### Getting Projectile

Clone the game's repository to a suitable location:

```
git clone https://github.com/etomzak/projectile.git projectile_trunk
```

## Running the game

From a terminal:

```
$> cd projectile_trunk
$> ./projectile-game.py
```

A short help page is available with

```
$> ./projectile-game.py -h
```
